Thus there is here no counterpart of ‘object’. In BFO 1.0 ‘process’ served as such a counterpart. In BFO 2.0 ‘process’ is, rather, the occurrent counterpart of ‘material entity’. Those natural – as contrasted with engineered, which here means: deliberately executed – units which do exist in the realm of occurrents are typically either parasitic on the existence of natural units on the continuant side, or they are fiat in nature. Thus we can count lives; we can count football games; we can count chemical reactions performed in experiments or in chemical manufacturing. We cannot count the processes taking place, for instance, in an episode of insect mating behavior.Even where natural units are identifiable, for example cycles in a cyclical process such as the beating of a heart or an organism’s sleep/wake cycle, the processes in question form a sequence with no discontinuities (temporal gaps) of the sort that we find for instance where billiard balls or zebrafish or planets are separated by clear spatial gaps. Lives of organisms are process units, but they too unfold in a continuous series from other, prior processes such as fertilization, and they unfold in turn in continuous series of post-life processes such as post-mortem decay. Clear examples of boundaries of processes are almost always of the fiat sort (midnight, a time of death as declared in an operating theater or on a death certificate, the initiation of a state of war)" xsd:string

However, this does not mean that fiat object parts are dependent for their existence on divisions or delineations effected by cognitive subjects. If, for example, it is correct to conceive geological layers of the Earth as fiat object parts of the Earth, then even though these layers were first delineated in recent times, still existed long before such delineation and what holds of these layers (for example that the oldest layers are also the lowest layers) did not begin to hold because of our acts of delineation.Treatment of material entity in BFOExamples viewed by some as problematic cases for the trichotomy of fiat object part, object, and object aggregate include: a mussel on (and attached to) a rock, a slime mold, a pizza, a cloud, a galaxy, a railway train with engine and multiple carriages, a clonal stand of quaking aspen, a bacterial community (biofilm), a broken femur. Note that, as Aristotle already clearly recognized, such problematic cases – which lie at or near the penumbra of instances defined by the categories in question – need not invalidate these categories. The existence of grey objects does not prove that there are not objects which are black and objects which are white; the existence of mules does not prove that there are not objects which are donkeys and objects which are horses.

Such units play a central role in almost all domains of natural science from particle physics to cosmology. Many scientific laws govern the units in question, employing general terms (such as ‘molecule’ or ‘planet’) referring to the types and subtypes of units, and also to the types and subtypes of the processes through which such units develop and interact. The division of reality into such natural units is at the heart of biological science, as also is the fact that these units may form higher-level units (as cells form multicellular organisms) and that they may also form aggregates of units, for example as cells form portions of tissue and organs form families, herds, breeds, species, and so on. At the same time, the division of certain portions of reality into engineered units (manufactured artifacts) is the basis of modern industrial technology, which rests on the distributed mass production of engineered parts through division of labor and on their assembly into larger, compound units such as cars and laptops.

def: "Metran is a software for Metabolic Flux Analysis implementing the Elementary Metabolite Units.\n\nMetabolic Flux Analysis (MFA) has emerged as a tool of great significance for metabolic engineering and quantitative cell physiology. An important limitation of MFA, as carried out via stable isotope labeling and GC-MS measurements, is the large number of isotopomer/cumomer equations that need to be solved, especially when multiple isotopic tracers are used for the labeling of the system. This restriction reduces the ability of MFA to fully utilize the power of multiple isotopic tracers in elucidating the physiology of realistic situations comprising complex bioreaction networks. \n\nTo address this limitation, we have developed a novel framework for modeling of isotopic tracer distributions that significantly reduces the number of variables, without any loss of information. The EMU framework is based on a highly efficient decomposition method that identifies the minimum amount of information needed to simulate isotopic labeling within a reaction network using the knowledge of atomic transitions occurring in the network reactions. The functional units generated by the decomposition algorithm, called elementary metabolite units (EMUs), form the new basis for generating system equations that describe the relationship between fluxes and isotopomer abundances.\n\nThe EMU decomposition algorithm is completely unsupervised and converges within seconds even for very genome-wide network models. Isotopomer abundances simulated using the EMU framework are identical to those obtained using the isotopomer and cumomer frameworks, however, requiring significantly less computation time. For a typical carbon labeling system the total number of equations that needs to be solved is reduced by one order-of-magnitude (100s EMUs vs. 1000s cumomers). As such, the EMU framework is most efficient for the analysis of labeling by multiple isotopic tracers. For example, the analysis of gluconeogenesis network model with 2H, 13C, and 18O tracers requires only 354 EMUs compared to >2,000,000 isotopomers" []

def: "“midcor.R” is an “R”-program that performs a primary analysis of isotopic isomers (isotopomers) distribution obtained by Gas Chromatography coupled with Mass Spectrometry (GCMS). The aim of this analysis is to have a correct distribution of isotopes originated from substrates that are artificially enriched with specific isotopes (usually 13C). To this end the program performs a correction for natural occurring isotopes and also correction for “impurities” of the assay media that give peaks overlapping with the spectra of analyzed labeled metabolites. This program offers two ways of corrections of “impurities” resulted from overlapping the assayed mass isotopomer distribution with peaks produced either by unknown metabolites in the media, or by different fragments produced by the assayed metabolite.\n\nThe source code is available from https://github.com/seliv55/midcor" []

It is also possible to replace all of the carbons with 13C, although in this case the spectroscopy has to deal with the network of couplings among bonded carbons. Similarly, all of the hydrogens can be replaced with deuterons in order to attenuate the dipolar couplings among the hydrogens that often present complications and difficulties in the experiments."

This enables system-wide quantification of reversible, parallel, and cyclic metabolic pathways that would be otherwise unidentifiable based solely upon measurements of extracellular nutrient uptake and product excretion (Zamboni et al., 2009).\n\nWhile 13C MFA provides a rich source of phenotypic information, the application of this technique to mammalian systems presents unique challenges. In particular, the presence of subcellular compartmentation, complex media formulations, and slow labeling dynamics can lead to significant difficulties in experimental design and data interpretation (Zamboni, 2011)."

It relies on pumps to pass a pressurized liquid solvent containing the sample mixture through a column filled with a solid adsorbent material. \n\nThe schematic of an HPLC instrument typically includes a degasser, sampler, pumps, and a detector. The sampler brings the sample mixture into the mobile phase stream which carries it into the column. The pumps deliver the desired flow and composition of the mobile phase through the column. The detector generates a signal proportional to the amount of sample component emerging from the column, hence allowing for quantitative analysis of the sample components. A digital microprocessor and user software control the HPLC instrument and provide data analysis." xsd:string

By changing the rate with which medium is added to the bioreactor the growth rate of the microorganism can be easily controlled. It allows culture to reach physiological steady state and chemostat is often used to gather steady state data about an organism in order to generate a mathematical model relating to its metabolic processes.\nThe name chemostat stems from \"Chemical environment is static\".\n\nThe  most  striking  advantages of chemostats are two-fold: microorganisms can be kept at  a  constant  environmental  conditions  until  the  cultivated microorganisms  reach  steady  state,  defined  by  their  specific growth  rate  (μ)  being  in  balance  with  the  dilution  rate  (D). Once the system is equilibrated, the steady state data can be used for quantification of physiological parameters and metabolic rates of organisms, which are eventually required for the parameterization  of  mathematical  models."

id: NMR:1000008
name: quadrature detection
comment: One of the problems that should be apparent after observing the spectrum and the FID is that it is not possible \nto determine if the frequency is positive or negative. The instrument uses a spectrometer \nfrequency and all signal frequencies are measured relative to the spectrometer frequency.  If a molecule \nproduces two signals, one at 300,000,001 Hz and another at 299,999,999 Hz, and the spectrometer frequency \nis 300,000,000 Hz, the first signal is at +1 Hz and the second is at -1 Hz.  Electronically the lower frequency \nsignals are very easy frequency to detect, transmit, amplify and sample.\nThe complication with this rotating frame of reference is that a single detector can not distinguish positive and \nnegative frequencies. This problem is why quadrature detection is important.  Quadrature detection uses two detector channels \nseparated by 90 degrees.  These are referred to as the real channel and the imaginary channel.  Using these \ntwo channels, it is possible to distinguish positive and negative frequencies.  This section shows how the \nquadrature signal is processed to obtain an NMR spectrum.\nThe Fourier transform produces a complex number with a real and an imaginary component.  The Re function \nextracts the real spectrum and the Im function extracts the imaginary spectrum from the complex number.

def: "Nuclear magnetic resonance decoupling (NMR decoupling for short) is a special method used in nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy where a sample to be analyzed is irradiated at a certain frequency or frequency range to eliminate fully or partially the effect of coupling between certain nuclei. NMR coupling refers to the effect of nuclei on each other in atoms within a couple of bonds distance of each other in molecules. This effect causes NMR signals in a spectrum to be split into multiple peaks which are up to several hertz frequency from each other. Decoupling fully or partially eliminates splitting of the signal between the nuclei irradiated and other nuclei such as the nuclei being analyzed in a certain spectrum. NMR spectroscopy and sometimes decoupling can help determine structures of chemical compounds." []

It then deconvolutes the resulting NMR spectrum using a reference spectral library, which here contains the signatures of more than 60 metabolites.

def: "Based on both nmrML.xsd (XML Schema Definition) and CV params (such as ontologies nmrCV, UO, CHEBI ...), a converter written in Java was developed that automatically generates nmrML files, from raw files of the major NMR vendors. The choice of Java was guided by i)  the JAXB framework  (Java Architecture for XML Binding), ii) its OS-platform independence and iii) strengthened by the existence of a useful java library (i.e [nmr-fid-tool](https://github.com/LuisFF/nmr-fid-tool)) for further processing and visualisation of the resulting nmrML data. \nAs nmrML intents to gather and integrate several types of data and corresponding metadata in a single file, it is necessary to process each data source separately. Thus, two command tools were developed.\n\nThe first one, nmrMLcreate allows to create a new nmrML file, based on available Bruker or Varian/Agilent raw files.\n\nThe second one, nmrMLproc allows to add and fill in additional sections corresponding to the data processing step."

comment: def: A compound that is added to an NMR sample to enable the alignment of spectra. The power of NMR is that for most nuclei the NMR frequency changes very slightly with different molecular environment or chemical bonding. These shifts are very small, on the order of 1 part in 10+9.  This is referred to as "Chemical Shift." Tables of chemical shifts are tabulated and used to determine molecular structure. Combining NMR chemical shift information with other NMR information such as peak integration, coupling constants and Nuclear Overhauser Enhancement (NOE) can result in complete three-dimensional molecular structures of molecules in solution without using X-ray crystallography.

comment: def: A magnet which induces a certain frequency (MHz) and which has a certain bore diameter.\n   altdef: The NMR signal is a natural physical property of the certain atomic nuclei but it can only be detected with an external magnetic field. A magnet is a fundamental part of an NMR instrument which induces an electromagnetic force field (RF pulse) and by this excites and aligns the spins of the electrons of the NMR acquisition nucleus. It is usually a big (superconducting) electromagnet which is cooled by liquid helium and can be adjusted to a frequency between 200 and 950 MHz. The magnetic field strength is measured in Tesla or Gauss.

comment: def: The Bruker BioSpin CryoProbe is a high-performance cryogenically cooled probe developed for high-resolution applications. It has improved signal/noise (S/N) ratios obtained by reducing the operating temperature of the coil and the pre-amplifier. As a result, the efficiency of the coil is improved and the noise of the coil and the pre-amplifier are reduced.The dramatic increase in the S/N ratio by a factor of 3-4, as compared to conventional probes, leads to a possible reduction in experiment time of up to 16 or a reduction in required sample concentration by a factor of up to 4. The CryoProbes possess key characteristics for NMR analysis:\n   Significant S/N gains (with moderately salty samples also)\n   Short pulse widths\n   Short ring down times\n   Linear behavior in power response\n   Gradient capability\n   CryoProbes are available as Triple Resonance, Dual, Selective X Detection, MicroImaging, and Quad Nucleus Probes configurations at 400 MHz and higher\n   All high resolution probes have a lock circuit\n   All high resolution probes have Z-gradient\n   defprov: Bruker website

name: high resolution magic angle spin probe
comment: def: Samples that are neither solid nor liquid, being of biological, chemical, and/or pharmaceutical interest, reveal highly resolved spectra when magic angle spinning is applied. The correct solution is a gradient, such that the field varies along the spinner axis. This so-called Magic Angle Gradient is employed in Bruker’s high resolution Magic Angle Spinning (hr-MAS) probes, and is implemented in such a way that it is compatible with the stator and does not interfere with the sample eject/insert. Bruker BioSpin has developed a series of dedicated probes for standard bore magnets to accommodate the rapidly expanding field of hr-MAS. These probes are available in double (e.g. 1H and 13C) and triple resonance (e.g., 1H, 13C, 15N) modes and come equipped with a deuterium lock channel. The probes have automatic sample ejection and insertion capability, with the availability of an optional sample changer, enabling fully automated sample runs. Probes can be equipped with an optional B0 gradient, directed along the magic angle, so that gradient spectroscopy can be done used.\n   defprov: Bruker website\n   altdef: High resolution MAS (hr-MAS) provides an easy means of obtaining high resolution spectra for a variety of samples that would otherwise result in poorly resolved spectra.

Evoked by many exciting applications, there is a need for analytical methods which require less amounts of sample. Bruker BioSpin meets this challenge with a revolutionary NMR probe design: The 1mm MicroProbe. It operates with disposable 1mm capillary sample tubes and the sample volume of 5 microliters enables the use of lowest amounts of sample to run all high resolution NMR experiments with outstanding sensitivity and up to 16 times faster measurements. Due to the TXI-type probe design, the z-gradient coil and the automatic matching and tuning accessory, the 1mm MicroProbe can be used for a wide variety of NMR experiments. The key advantages of this probe include:\n   up to 4 times higher mass sensitivity than 5mm conventional probes (with respect to the same sample amount)\n   excellent solvent suppression properties\n   virtually no salt effect\n   discrete samples in tubes that can be sealed and stored\n   automation accessory for sample preparation and handling available\n   defprov: Bruker website

name: reagent role
def: "A role inhering in a biological or chemical entity that is intended to be applied in a scientific technique to participate (or have molecular components that participate) in a chemical reaction that facilitates the generation of data about some entity distinct from the bearer, or the generation of some specified material output distinct from the bearer." []
comment: (copied from ReO)\nReagents are distinguished from instruments or devices that also participate in scientific techniques by the fact that reagents are chemical or biological in nature and necessarily participate in or have parts that participate in some chemical interaction or reaction during their intended participation in some technique.  By contrast, instruments do not participate in a chemical reaction/interaction during the technique.\n\nReagents are distinguished from study subjects/evaluants in that study subjects and evaluants are that about which conclusions are drawn and knowledge is sought in an investigation - while reagents, by definition, are not.  It should be noted, however, that reagent and study subject/evaluant roles can be borne by instances of the same type of material entity - but a given instance will realize only one of these roles in the execution of a given assay or technique. For example, taq polymerase can bear a reagent role or an evaluant role.  In a DNA sequencing assay aimed at generating sequence data about some plasmid, the reagent role of the taq polymerase is realized. In an assay to evaluate the quality of the taq polymerase itself, the evaluant/study subject role of the taq is realized, but not the reagent role since the taq is the subject about which data is generated.\n\nIn regard to the statement that reagents are 'distinct' from the specified outputs of a technique, note that a reagent may be incorporated into a material output of a technique, as long as the IDENTITY of this output is distinct from that of the bearer of the reagent role.  For example, dNTPs input into a PCR are reagents that become part of the material output of this technique, but this output has a new identity (ie that of a 'nucleic acid molecule') that is distinct from the identity of the dNTPs that comprise it.  Similarly, a biotin molecule input into a cell labeling technique are reagents that become part of the specified output, but the identity of the output is that of some modified cell specimen which shares identity with the input unmodified cell specimen, and not with the biotin label. Thus, we see that an important criteria of 'reagent-ness' is that it is a facilitator, and not the primary focus of an investigation or material processing technique (ie not the specified subject/evaluant about which knowledge is sought, or the specified output material of the technique).

It leaves open if an organization is a material entity or a dependent continuant, as no consensus was reached on that.  The current placement as material is therefore temporary, in order to move forward with development. Here is the entire email summary, on which the definition is based:\n\n1) there are organization_member_roles (president, treasurer, branch\neditor), with individual persons as bearers\n\n2) there are organization_roles (employer, owner, vendor, patent holder)\n\n3) an organization has a charter / rules / bylaws, which specify what roles\nthere are, how they should be realized, and how to modify the\ncharter/rules/bylaws themselves.\n\nIt is debatable what the organization itself is (some kind of dependent\ncontinuant or an aggregate of people). This also determines who/what the\nbearer of organization_roles' are. My personal favorite is still to define\norganization as a kind of 'legal entity', but thinking it through leads to\nall kinds of questions that are clearly outside the scope of OBI.\n\nInterestingly enough, it does not seem to matter much where we place\norganization itself, as long as we can subclass it (University, Corporation,\nGovernment Agency, Hospital), instantiate it (Affymetrix, NCBI, NIH, ISO,\nW3C, University of Oklahoma), and have it play roles.\n\nThis leads to my proposal: We define organization through the statements 1 -\n3 above, but without an 'is a' statement for now. We can leave it in its\ncurrent place in the is_a hierarchy (material entity) or move it up to\n'continuant'. We leave further clarifications to BFO, and close this issue\nfor now." xsd:string

Therefore we have chosen to specifically exclude reagents from the definition of \"device\", and are enumerating the types of roles that a reagent can perform.\n\n2013-6-5 MHB: The following clarifications are outcomes of the May 2013 Philly Workshop. Reagents are distinguished from devices that also participate in scientific techniques by the fact that reagents are chemical or biological in nature and necessarily participate in some chemical interaction or reaction during the realization of their experimental role. By contrast, devices do not participate in such chemical reactions/interactions.  Note that there are cases where devices use reagent components during their operation, where the reagent-device distinction is less clear.  For example:\n\n(1) An HPLC machine is considered a device, but has a column that holds a stationary phase resin as an operational component.  This resin qualifies as a device if it participates purely in size exclusion, but bears a reagent role that is realized in the running of a column if it interacts electrostatically or chemically with the evaluant. The container the resin is in (“the column”) considered alone is a device. So the entire column as well as the entire HPLC machine are devices that have a reagent as an operating part.\n\n(2) A pH meter is a device, but its electrode component bears a reagent role in virtue of its interacting directly with the evaluant in execution of an assay.\n\n(3) A gel running  box  is a device that has a metallic lead as a component that participates in a chemical reaction with the running buffer when a charge is passed through it.  This metallic lead is considered to have a reagent role as a component of this device realized in the running of a gel.\n\nIn the examples above, a reagent is an operational component of a device, but the device itself does not realize a reagent role (as bearing a reagent role is not transitive across the part_of relation).  In this way, the asserted disjointness between a reagent and device holds, as both roles are never realized in the same bearer during execution of an assay.  " xsd:string

comment: The extent of a 'cultured cell population' is restricted only in that all cell members must share a propagation history (ie be derived through a common lineage of passages from an initial culture). In being defined in this way, this class can be used to refer to the populations that researchers actually use in the practice of science - ie are the inputs to culturing, experimentation, and sharing. The cells in such populations will be a relatively uniform population as they have experienced similar selective pressures due to their continuous co-propagation. And this population will also have a single passage number, again owing to their common passaging history. Cultured cell populations represent only a collection of cells (ie do not include media, culture dishes, etc), and include populations of cultured unicellular organisms or cultured multicellular organism cells. They can exist under active culture, stored in a quiescent state for future use, or applied experimentally.

We aimed to explore the mechanisms underlying FFA-induced insulin resistance in patients with HIV-lipodystrophy. Research Design and Methods: Using a randomized placebo-controlled cross-over design, we studied the effects of an overnight acipimox-induced suppression of FFA on glucose and FFA metabolism by using stable isotope labelled tracer techniques during basal conditions and a two-stage euglycemic, hyperinsulinemic clamp (20 mU insulin/m(2)/min; 50 mU insulin/m(2)/min) in nine patients with nondiabetic HIV-lipodystrophy. All patients received antiretroviral therapy. Biopsies from the vastus lateralis muscle were obtained during each stage of the clamp. Results: Acipimox treatment reduced basal FFA rate of appearance by 68.9% (52.6%-79.5%) and decreased plasma FFA concentration by 51.6 % (42.0%-58.9%), (both, P < 0.0001). Endogenous glucose production was not influenced by acipimox. During the clamp the increase in glucose-uptake was significantly greater after acipimox treatment compared to placebo (acipimox: 26.85 (18.09-39.86) vs placebo: 20.30 (13.67-30.13) mumol/kg/min; P < 0.01). Insulin increased phosphorylation of Akt (Thr(308)) and GSK-3beta (Ser(9)), decreased phosphorylation of glycogen synthase (GS) site 3a+b and increased GS-activity (I-form) in skeletal muscle (P < 0.01). Acipimox decreased phosphorylation of GS (site 3a+b) (P < 0.02) and increased GS-activity (P < 0.01) in muscle. Conclusion: The present study provides direct evidence that suppression of lipolysis in patients with HIV-lipodystrophy improves insulin-stimulated peripheral glucose-uptake. The increased glucose-uptake may in part be explained by increased dephosphorylation of GS (site 3a+b) resulting in increased GS activity." xsd:string

They belong to the new genomics technologies which have important applications in the biological, agricultural and pharmaceutical sciences. There are myriad sources of uncertainty in microarray experiments, and rigorous experimental design is essential for fully realizing the potential of these valuable resources. Two questions frequently asked by biologists on the brink of conducting cDNA or two-colour, spotted microarray experiments are 'Which mRNA samples should be competitively hybridized together on the same slide?' and 'How many times should each slide be replicated?' Early experience has shown that whilst the field of classical experimental design has much to offer this emerging multi-disciplinary area, new approaches which accommodate features specific to the microarray context are needed. In this paper, we propose optimal designs for factorial and time course experiments, which are special designs arising quite frequently in microarray experimentation. Our criterion for optimality is statistical efficiency based on a new notion of admissible designs; our approach enables efficient designs to be selected subject to the information available on the effects of most interest to biologists, the number of arrays available for the experiment, and other resource or practical constraints, including limitations on the amount of mRNA probe. We show that our designs are superior to both the popular reference designs, which are highly inefficient, and to designs incorporating all possible direct pairwise comparisons. Moreover, our proposed designs represent a substantial practical improvement over classical experimental designs which work in terms of standard interactions and main effects. The latter do not provide a basis for meaningful inference on the effects of most interest to biologists, nor make the most efficient use of valuable and limited resources." xsd:string

The assertion P preceded_by P1 tells us something about Ps in general: that is, it tells us something about what happened earlier, given what we know about what happened later. Thus it does not provide information pointing in the opposite direction, concerning instances of P1 in general; that is, that each is such as to be succeeded by some instance of P. Note that an assertion to the effect that P preceded_by P1 is rather weak; it tells us little about the relations between the underlying instances in virtue of which the preceded_by relation obtains. Typically we will be interested in stronger relations, for example in the relation immediately_preceded_by, or in relations which combine preceded_by with a condition to the effect that the corresponding instances of P and P1 share participants, or that their participants are connected by relations of derivation, or (as a first step along the road to a treatment of causality) that the one process in some way affects (for example, initiates or regulates) the other." xsd:string
